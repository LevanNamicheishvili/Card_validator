Credit Card Number Validator

This repository contains a Python implementation of a credit card number validator using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum validation algorithm used to validate credit card numbers.

Features:
- Basic credit card number validation based on the Luhn algorithm
- Removes non-digit characters from the input card number
- Reverses the card number for processing
- Calculates the checksum by doubling every second digit and summing the individual digits of the doubled numbers
- Validates if the total sum is divisible by 10

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `card_validator.py` file and modify the `card_number` variable to the desired credit card number.
3. Run the script using Python 3.
4. The script will output whether the provided credit card number is valid or invalid.

Please note that this implementation focuses on the basic validation of credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm and does not include advanced checks for card types, expiration dates, or CVV codes. It serves as a starting point for credit card validation in Python.

Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or additional features to add.
